Bioinformatics Software on HPC Clusters
========================================

This documentation is for **HPC administrators and staff** who run or support
many-core clusters and want to become familiar with common
bioinformatics tools and workflows: downloading public data, genomics and
RNA-seq pipelines, R-based analyses with job arrays, and more. Examples use **SLURM**, 
**Biocontainers**, and **Singularity/Apptainer**, and emphasize resource requests, thread scaling,
and reproducibility.
