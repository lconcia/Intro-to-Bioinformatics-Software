What are NGS data?
-------------------
NGS data (Next-Generation Sequencing data) are the digital output generated from biological samples using high-throughput DNA or RNA sequencing technologies.

They are obtained by extracting genetic material (DNA or RNA),  preparing sequencing libraries (fragmentation, adapter ligation, amplification),
and then running the material through a sequencing platform that reads millions to billions of nucleotide fragments in parallel. 
NGS data typically contain short or long sequence reads (strings of A, T, C, G — or U in RNA), along with associated quality scores and metadata. 

From these data, researchers can identify genetic variants, gene expression levels, mutations, structural changes, and other genomic features.

Why NGS technologies are important
----------------------------------

NGS sequencing enables rapid, high-throughput, and cost-effective analysis of DNA/RNA.
The most common applications are:

- **Oncology** and Cancer Research: Identification of somatic mutations in solid tumors and liquid biopsies to guide personalized treatments (targeted therapies).
- **Clinical Diagnostics and Hereditary Diseases**: Diagnosis of genetic disorders, including rare diseases and hereditary cancer syndromes, through whole-exome (WES) or whole-genome sequencing (WGS).
- **Infectious Disease Surveillance**: Rapid identification of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi) and tracking of antimicrobial resistance and outbreaks.

- **Transcriptomics (RNA-Seq)**: Measuring gene expression levels, studying alternative splicing, and identifying fusion genes in research and diagnostics.
- **Microbiome Analysis**: Characterizing the diversity and composition of microbial communities in environmental and clinical samples.
- **Pharmacogenomics**: Understanding how an individual's genetic makeup affects their response to specific medications.

NGS data analysis pipeline 
----------------------------------

NGS data are analyzed through a series of computational steps to extract meaningful biological insights from millions to billions of raw sequence reads.
The exact workflow depends on the experiment (e.g., whole-genome sequencing, RNA-seq), but the core steps are similar:

* **Quality control (QC)**
Raw reads (in FASTQ format) are checked for sequencing quality, adapter contamination, and biases. Low-quality bases are trimmed.

* **Adapter trimming**
Raw sequence reads contain synthetic oligonucleotides introduced by the library preparation. 
These nucleotides do not belong to the biological sample and need to be removed before the alignment. 

* **Alignment to the genome assembly**
Reads are aligned to a reference genome (e.g., the human genome) or transcriptome using algorithms such as BWA, bowtie2, or STAR.

* **Post-processing**
The output of the alignment (BAM/CRAM files) need to be prepared for downstream analyses by sorting, indexing, filtering and removing duplicate reads.

* **Downstream analysis**
Additional steps depend on the type the experiment and can be performed with various tools: bedtools, deeptools, HTseq, etc...
Often these tools cannot run with multi-threading and benefit from the parallelization with SLURM.

Overall, NGS analysis combines bioinformatics algorithms, statistical modeling, and biological interpretation to
